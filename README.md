In this notebook, I attempt to solve the problem of matching drivers to riders, commonly known as ride-share algorithms. I've implemented a series of optimization models to improve ETA prediction, matching, and pricing algorithms. 

I utilize various optimization techniques currently employed by ride-hailing platforms such as Uber and Lyft. These include the first-dispatch protocol, batching dispatch protocol, and maximum dispatch radius. Detailed information about these methods can be found within the notebook.
